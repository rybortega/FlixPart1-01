## Flix Part 1

### Features
#### REQUIRED (18pts)

- [X] Implement orientation responsivity
  - App should neatly arrange data in both landscape and portrait mode
- [X] Implement Glide to display placeholder graphics during loading

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

### Notes
I've set the vopular movie to the seven for the walkthrogh, because otherwise only about two movies were not popular.
To get the borders only on one side of the text block was harder than I expected.

### Open-source libraries used

- [Android Async HTTP](https://github.com/codepath/CPAsyncHttpClient) - Simple asynchronous HTTP requests with JSON parsing
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) - Image loading and caching library for Androids
